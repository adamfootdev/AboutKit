AboutKit provides developers for Apple platforms with the ability to add an About screen to their apps. This built using SwiftUI so can be displayed natively from a SwiftUI app or using a UIHostingController in a UIKit app.

This has been localised into multiple languages and the buttons will automatically adapt to your app始s accent color.

For users who previously used AboutKit for showing the features list, please use [FeaturesKit](https://github.com/adamfootdev/FeaturesKit).

dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/adamfootdev/AboutKit.git", from: "3.0.0")
]
```

## Usage

To start using the framework, you'll need to import it first:

```swift
import AboutKit
```

### AKConfiguration

This is a struct containing all of the relevant details required to configure AboutKit. It can be created like so:

```swift
let configuration = AKConfiguration(
    app: app, 
    otherApps: otherApps, 
    showShareApp: .always, 
    showWriteReview: .always
)
```

### AKMyApp

This is a struct containing details about the current app. It can be created like so:

```swift
let app = AKMyApp(
    id: "123456789", 
    name: "Example App", 
    appIcon: UIImage(named: "app-icon"), 
    developer: developer, 
    email: "exampleapp@example.com", 
    websiteURL: URL(string: "https://www.example.com")!, 
    profiles: [profile], 
    privacyPolicyURL: URL(string: "https://www.example.com/privacy-policy")!, 
    termsOfUseURL: URL(string: "https://www.example.com/terms-of-use")!, 
    testFlightURL: URL(string: "https://www.example.com/testflight")!, 
    acknowledgements: acknowledgements
)
```

If a value for the app icon is not provided, one will attempt to be downloaded from the App Store based on the provided app ID. The app ID can be found in App Store Connect or from the app's URL, e.g. <https://apps.apple.com/app/id123456789>

### AKDeveloper

```swift
let developer = AKDeveloper(
    id: "987654321", 
    name: "App Developer", 
    profiles: [profile]
)
```

The developer ID can be found by locating the App Store page that contains all of your apps e.g. <https://apps.apple.com/developer/id987654321>

### AKProfile

This is a struct containing details about about a social media profile relating to either the developer or the app itself. It supports multiple platforms such as X and Mastodon. It can be created like so:

    platform: .reddit
)
```

### AKOtherApp

    appIcon: UIImage(named: "app-icon")
)
```

If a value for the app icon is not provided, one will attempt to be downloaded from the App Store based on the provided app ID. The app ID can be found in App Store Connect or from the app's URL, e.g. <https://apps.apple.com/app/id123456789>
